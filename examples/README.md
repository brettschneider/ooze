# Ooze Examples #
This directory contains example projects that use the Ooze dependency
injector.  The following projected are provided:

## Label maker ##

This is a simple, single-file script that reads a CSV file of 
contact info and generates mailing labels for each contact.  It
does not require the installation of any other packages, beyond
Ooze itself.

Project source: [label-maker](./label-maker)

## Flask ##

This is a multi-module (2 files) app that demonstrates how
Ooze can seemlessly integrate with Flask.  This example will
require you to install both Ooze and Flash (pip install).

Project source: [flask](./flask)
